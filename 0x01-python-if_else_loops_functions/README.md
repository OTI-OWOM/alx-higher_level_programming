# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Overview
This project aims to solidify your understanding of core Python programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and functions. By the end, you will be able to explain these concepts confidently without external resources.

## Learning Objectives
By the completion of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand why Python is a powerful programming language.
- Explain the importance of indentation in Python.
- Use `if`, `if-else`, and `if-elif-else` statements effectively.
- Write meaningful comments in your code.
- Assign values to variables and manipulate them.
- Utilize `while` and `for` loops in Python.
- Understand how Python’s `for` loop differs from C’s.
- Implement `break` and `continue` statements in loops.
- Use `else` clauses with loops.
- Explain and use the `pass` statement appropriately.
- Leverage the `range()` function for loop control.
- Define and call functions in Python.
- Understand the behavior of functions without a `return` statement.
- Explain the scope of variables in Python.
- Interpret Python's traceback error messages.
- Use arithmetic operators efficiently.

## Project Requirements
### Python Scripts
- You can use any of the following text editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All Python scripts will be run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- Every file should end with a newline.
- The first line of each script must be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- You must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) for coding style.
- All files must be executable.
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`.

### C Scripts (where applicable)
- Editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All C files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with `gcc` using flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Follow the Betty style guide.
- No global variables allowed.
- Max 5 functions per file.
- Push header files (`lists.h`), and all header files should be include guarded.
