# 0x02. Python - import & modules

This repository contains Python scripts for performing a variety of basic tasks including arithmetic operations, argument handling, and simple calculations. Each file corresponds to a different task, with a focus on Python fundamentals.

---

## File Overview

### 0. **0-add.py**
- **Description**: Adds two numbers and prints the result. This file demonstrates the basic structure of a Python script with input and output operations.

---

### 1. **0-import_add.py**
- **Description**: Imports a function from another module to perform addition. This task focuses on modular programming in Python.

---

### 2. **1-calculation.py**
- **Description**: Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and prints the results. Demonstrates the use of mathematical operators in Python.

---

### 3. **2-args.py**
- **Description**: Prints the number of arguments passed to the script, followed by the arguments themselves. Demonstrates how to handle command-line arguments in Python.

---

### 4. **3-infinite_add.py**
- **Description**: Adds all command-line arguments and prints the sum. This task is useful for understanding loops and argument parsing in Python.

---

### 5. **4-hidden_discovery.py**
- **Description**: Prints all names defined by the "hidden_4" module, excluding names starting with underscores. This file demonstrates the use of the `dir()` function and name filtering in Python.

---

### 6. **5-variable_load.py**
- **Description**: Imports a variable from another module and prints its value. This file is an exercise in variable importing and handling across multiple files.

---

### 7. **100-my_calculator.py**
- **Description**: A simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input. This task combines command-line argument handling with mathematical operations.

---

### 8. **101-easy_print.py**
- **Description**: A one-liner script that prints a message. Demonstrates minimal Python script design.

---

### 9. **102-magic_calculation.py**
- **Description**: Contains Python code designed to replicate a given bytecode. This task focuses on bytecode understanding and reverse engineering in Python.

---

### 10. **103-fast_alphabet.py**
- **Description**: Prints the alphabet in uppercase in a single line. This file highlights concise string handling techniques.

---

---

### Additional Files

- **add_0.py**: Provides an `add` function for addition. Used by `0-import_add.py`.
- **calculator_1.py**: Contains basic arithmetic functions used by `100-my_calculator.py`.
- **hidden_4.pyc**: Precompiled Python file for hidden functions.
- **variable_load_5.py**: Module containing a variable to be imported by `5-variable_load.py`.

---

### Notes

- Each task focuses on demonstrating basic Python programming skills.
- The repository emphasizes fundamental operations such as importing, command-line argument handling, and modularity in Python scripts.
